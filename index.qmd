# Welcome to my website!

I hold a PhD in Economics from the University of Houston. Previously, I worked as an antitrust economist at the Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE) in Mexico. I also worked as an economist at the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS).

I have presented my work at the Society of Labor Economists (SOLE) Annual Conference, at the Eastern Economic Assciociation, and the Southern Economic Association Meetings.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.marvinschmitt@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
